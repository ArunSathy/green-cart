**Grocery Delivery App**

**Description**

The Grocery Delivery App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to browse a variety of grocery products, add items to their cart, and place orders for home delivery. The app features user authentication, product management, and an intuitive, responsive user interface.
